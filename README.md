# CSCI3100_D5

CSCI3100 Group Project (Course Selection System)

5.4. Testing Document and Final Commented Code
The testing document should contain a general test plan and detailed test cases for your application.
The document should be written in text font Times New Roman and size 11. The main body should
be no more than 15 pages. Please refer to Appendix 4 for more detail. The final commented code
should be handed in by pushing the code to your GitHub repository. You should include a detailed
README on your GitHub repository describing your application and the requirements of running
CSCI3100 Software Engineering, Dept. of CSE, The Chinese University of Hong Kong
your application. The code will be graded based upon the availability of the README and the
readability of your code.
Although generally, the project grade is for the whole team and will not be assigned individually to
the members, each team member must be aware that a major part of his or her final project grade
depends on teamwork. Failures to cooperate with other team members and to invest an equitable
amount of effort can lead to undesirable outcomes, particularly when other team members raise
complaints about the non-participating members. On the project Demo Day, if there is any complaint
about free-rider(s), please raise the case right after your project demo is done. We will verify with
all your team members regarding the validity of the complaint.
